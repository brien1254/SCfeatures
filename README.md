# SCFeatures 
modified snapchat version with SCFeatures tweak which bypass connection issue for Phantom or Snap++ Tweaks

### Info

this the first public beta it may hangs or has issue like forcing log-out etc but the bypass function working 100% 

needs improvements to fix those two issues ( forcing log-out or hanging the app UI ) [ will try to improve it ASAP ]

## how to install

you need to install optool ( or download it and change line 65 to pointing it to the correct path in modify_app )

connect your device and login with your developer account id in Xcode

then click Run to install the app on your device or build to build ipa only

# HAVE FUN :)
